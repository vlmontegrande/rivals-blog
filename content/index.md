Welcome to my Rivals of Aether blog! This is where I share my thoughts on the competitive platform fighters Rivals of Aether and Rivals of Aether 2.

## Introduction
With the conclusion of the Rivals Championship Series (RCS) with its eighth season, and the beginning of Rivals of Aether 2's competitive lifespan, we can look back on the scene to crown the players at the summit of Rivals 1. This ranking heavily considers the official RCS top fifty rankings provided by Rivals of Aether themselves each season, as well as the events considered by the ranking teams. Offline events are weighed more than offline events. Tournament stats may be slightly inaccurate due to lost media, alternate usernames, and other factors. Whether a tournament is considered RCS or community/GRL mostly comes from the start.gg schedule for each RCS season and the introduction page the official top fifty rankings. I favor consistency and peak performances on these rankings. These are, of course, my opinions. Feel free to contact me with any comments or feedback you have. With that out of the way, let's get into it!

*NOTE: Due to the European scene (and other regions) being so disconnected from the North American one, this ranking doesn't include players outside of the NA scene*

    **Greatest Achievement:**
    
    Another old school legend of the game, BioBirb, formally known as Windows, is a Wrastor main and community figure. He has dabbled in content creation and commentary in the latter half of his Rivals career. Before that, though, he was a top player in his own right. 

7. Kusi

    **Season Rankings:**
    N/A, N/A, N/A, N/A, 3, 5, 7, 3

    **Tournament Results:**
    Total Wins: 3, RCS Wins: 2, Total Top 8's: 29, RCS Top 8's: 19

    **Greatest Achievement:**

    Kusi has had similar placements to Xaro, placing top ten in four seasons. However, with one less season of rankings and without the elusive number one title, Kusi just misses out on a higher spot on this list. Make no mistake, if there were a few more seasons of RCS after season eight, Kusi would be one of the biggest risers. Making his start in the latter half of RCS, he proved to be a top threat very quickly. Mostly utilizing Ori and Sein, he added a Wrastor in the final RCS season. Although his Ori was extremely potent, his Wrastor elevated him, and he found himself in an extremely close race between him, CakeAssault, and Soulrifle. The ridiculous punish game that Wrastor granted helped him win his first and second RCS majors ever, propelling him into the top echelon of Rivals players. He continued this meteoric rise by being a dominant force in Rivals 2.

6. Xaro 

    **Season Rankings:**
    N/A, N/A, 37, 5, 1, 3, 6, N/A

    **Tournament Results:**
    Total Wins: 7, RCS Wins: 3, Total Top 8's: 33, RCS Top 8's: 19

    **Greatest Achievement:**

    As one of only three players to reach the ranking summit in a Rivals season, his place outside the top five might seem criminal. However, this is due to a couple of factors. His number one finish came in the online season during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outside of that finish, he’s been ranked in the top ten for only three more seasons, and top fifty in another. Despite all this, he’s made his mark as a force in the competitive scene.
    His Orcane was a beauty to behold, especially since Orcane is a rarer character and considered less powerful than some other characters. In his prime, he was the greatest threat to CakeAssault in bracket, netting many wins against him. Had he been more active, he could’ve been near the top of this list. Nevertheless, the king of random down strongs belongs on this list.

5. ZeeBee

    **Season Rankings:**
    N/A, 23, 8, 7, 6, 6, 4, 7

    **Tournament Results:**
    Total Wins: 1, RCS Wins: 0, Total Top 8's: 40, RCS Top 8's: 27

    **Greatest Achievement:**
    

    Imagine someone who wants to play optimally all the time. Someone who chooses the same options because they’re safe, easy, and effective. ZeeBee is the antithesis to that philosophy. Watching ZeeBee for an extended period, you’re bound to see a goofy or reckless option here or there. More often than not, you’ll find that it works. 
    His career has also been defined by his steady top-level play. Making the top fifty in seven seasons, he’s been around from the start. Although Kragg is his staple character, he is not afraid to branch out. He’s played Etalus for a while, and he added a Mollo at the tail end of the RCS’s life. His Mollo was especially fun to watch; he would often spam Mollo’s finisher bombs, and self-destruct just as often as he would KO the opponent. Despite this, no one can deny his place as one of the greatest.

4. MSB 

    **Season Rankings:**
    1, 1, 2, 19, 27, N/A, N/A, N/A

    **Tournament Results:**
    Total Wins: 3, RCS Wins: 1, Total Top 8's: 56, RCS Top 8's: 39

    **Greatest Achievement:**
    NA RCS Season 3 September Monthly 2018, 136 entrants, his biggest tournament win

    MSB and Penguin have had similar career trajectories. Both have shown remarkable consistency; they’ve been ranked in every single RCS season. CakeAssault is the only other player that has achieved this. Both have had incredible peaks, with Penguin reaching second in the world and MSB reaching sixth. And, most importantly, both have become the embodiment of their character. In MSB’s case, he’s invented an ungodly amount of Kragg tech. Every single Kragg player, whether they know it or not, has performed things that MSB pioneered. No one else has embraced a character more than him, and it’s paid dividends for MSB.

3. FullStream

    **Season Rankings:**
    1, 1, 2, 19, 27, N/A, N/A, N/A

    **Tournament Results:**
    Total Wins: 15, RCS Wins: 14, Total Top 8's: 34, RCS Top 8's: 28

    **Greatest Achievement:**
    Genesis 6 2019, 209 entrants, proved he was still that guy in the Cake era

    Before CakeAssault, FullStream was the original face of Rivals. Piloting Etalus to great effect, one wouldn’t believe from his gameplay that Rivals of Aether was his first platform fighter. He’s perhaps the only player besides Cake that’s shown true dominance in the competitive landscape. Sporting two top finishes and another second-place finish in the first three RCS seasons is no easy feat. The sheer number of tournaments won in those first seasons proved he was the man to beat for the early age of Rivals. Although he stepped away from the game in his prime, there’s no denying that he’s one of the greatest to ever touch the sticks. 

2. Penguin 

    **Season Rankings:**
    32, 9, 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5

    **Tournament Results:**
    Total Wins: 13, RCS Wins: 7, Total Top 8's: 59, RCS Top 8's: 45

    **Greatest Achievement:**
    NA RCS Finals 2021, 407 entrants, finally won an RCS finale

    Penguin is the paragon of consistency. She’s one of three players that have been ranked on the RCS top fifty for every season that the RCS has been active. Her accolades include exceptional tournament wins, numerous top eight placings, and a custom skin added to the game. There was a period where Penguin and CakeAssault was the main grand finals matchup for every major. From an outside perspective, that may sound boring. However, those sets produced some of the greatest moments in Rivals competitive history. For a specific example, watch Penguin and CakeAssault at Smash ‘N Splash 5, one of the most electrifying sets of Rivals ever played. 
    
    As a player, Penguin utilized Absa’s unique movement like no other. The way she danced around platforms with gravity jumps and up-b edge cancels made her slippery and difficult to catch in neutral. Moreover, the way she controlled space with Absa’s cloud made every wrong move by her opponents punishable with a death by cloud kick. Arguably Penguin’s most dominating trait is her adaptations throughout a set. It’s not unusual for her to concede a game before completely steamrolling through the rest of the games. Her competitive spirit makes her an easy lock for number two on the ranking. 

1.  CakeAssault 

    **Season Rankings:**
    4, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1

    **Tournament Results:**
    Total Wins: 34, RCS Wins: 31, Total Top 8's: 64, RCS Top 8's: 58

    **Greatest Achievement:**
    1st at Riptide 2021, 245 entrants, beat his biggest rival (his shoulder)

    In many other competitive landscapes, the greatest of all time is disputed. Lebron vs. Michael Jordan in the NBA, Garry Kasparov vs. Magnus Carlsen in chess, Armada vs. mang0 in Super Smash Bros Melee. However, no Rivals fan is going to have any qualms about having CakeAssault as the king of the competitive Rivals of Aether world.

    CakeAssault’s playstyle had a heavy emphasis on getting the download on his opponents and brutally punishing mistakes. He used Forsburn’s good spacing and movement options to perfection. A testament to his skill was his use of parrying; he parried more than other top competitors to call out predictable approaches. His style of play left no room for anything less than perfect play from his opponents, and sometimes even that wasn’t enough.

    Ever since his humble beginnings entering as "Dank Fornasty" in season one tournaments, he's been the one to beat. After being ranked number four in the season-end rankings, he unlocked another level. For the next three seasons, the competition boiled down to "Cake and his rivals" as players aspired to be the one to upset the king.

    For all of his amazing qualities, his weakness was online tournaments. CakeAssault looked the most mortal during the online season brought about by the pandemic. During the limited ROCS and season five, he only gained a single tournament win out of the fifteen that occurred, and gained his career-worst fifth place in the rankings that year.

    As coronavirus restrictions subsided and tournaments began running in person, CakeAssault grew to his previous untouchable stature. Season six saw him win the three offline events that were held, including a Genesis win against his future enemies, Soulrifle211 and kusi, foreshadowing the rivalry that was incoming.

    The pinnacle of CakeAssault's illustrious career came during season seven. In an unprecedented show of dominance, Cake won EIGHT out of the NINE (!!) RCS tournaments, with the only one able to stop the #CakeSweep being a surging Seggo. 

    It takes a special type of player to place as the best in the world in five out of the eight RCS season rankings, and never even drop below the top five in the rest. He’s won pretty much every prominent offline tournament there is, and then some. There's been less than twenty RCS tournament winners, but he's won RCS tournaments under three different usernames. He kept up with the old guard of Ralph and FullStream, battled Penguin and Xaro in the heights of their careers, and fended off Soulrifle211, Seggo and kusi to end the scene with a bang. He's managed to become the villain, and also the protagonist. Without a shadow of a doubt, CakeAssault is the greatest to ever touch the game.
